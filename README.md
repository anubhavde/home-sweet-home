<h1><b>House Price Prediction</b></h1>
<p>In this project I have created a model for house price prediction using a python package <b>Turicreate</b>. Turi is a graph based high performance computation framework written in C++. The GraphLab project which was started by Prof. Carlos Guestrin is an open source project using the Apache License.</p>
<p>To start with the project you will have to install Turicreate library from https://github.com/apple/turicreate.</p>
